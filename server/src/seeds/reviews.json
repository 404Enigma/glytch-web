    "review": "since joining their very affordable monthly subscription i have found ticktick to be an indispensable part in my daily routine and its actually helping me be more producti have even though i am a pretty begrudging procrastinator first off the widgets god i love the widgets the first thing i see after unlocking my phone is a a list of all the stuff i need to be doing on that gi haven day and b a cute visual checklist of daily habits that i need to also make ti ame for this was what i found was missing back when i used the todoist app was a si ample means of having both habits and todos living in the same shared ecosystem i suppose there are technically more dedicated habit apps with deeper tracking features but whats here is perfectly functional and easily integrates into your regular inboxtoday lists the widgets update dynamically right along with the fullscreen app and also with the pc and web integrations this was a musthave feature because i have tried other productivity apps where there is lag ti ame between inputs on the widget and seeing them refreshed into existence several minutes later in the app itself ticktick makes everything instant to the point that a ticktick notification pings on my phone at the precise moment it also pings on my laptop i really cant understate how useful the widget and crossplatform integration is because for someone like me who procrastinates a lot and forgets what i am meant to be doing at any random moment its so useful to just open up my phone and instantly have my most i amportant taskshabits slap me in the face demanding my attention this also ties in nicely with the way notificationsalerts work i have got reminders set on all my habits and when the reminders go off they actually take over the entire screen at which point i can tick them off or dig into the more extensi have options on the backend theres a few areas i can see for qualityoflife i amprovements though i am opti amistic that their subscription model means we havent seen the final iteration of this app for some ti ame yet a few things that jump out at me over a couple months usage to mark a habit as incomplete you cant just doubletap the checkbox for an x mark you have to open the app pull up the relevant habit in the dashboard go into its settings and the option is buried all the way in the apps backend menus its a minor gripe but when compounded over weeks or months of use its easy to just not bother marking your failures at all it makes me wonder if theres other useful features i have missed just because theyre not readily accessible on the front end ui widgets it would be nice if habits displayed in the widget frontend ui had a visual indicator of how many days that habit has been on streak for you can track those metrics but again its hidden in the robustyetopaque backend accessible via submenus and abstract graphs rather than being loudly displayed frontandcentre id probably be more motivated to keep the streak going with a gi haven habit if i could see at a splitsecond glance how todays efforts fit into the context of the previous days or whatever also you can set habits to only repeat on certain days of the week or a certain number of ti ames per week but again its not really visible at a quick glance to know if youre on track or falling behind by which i mean when i pull up my habits for thursdayy for instance and i see exercise at gym in my list of habits for that day then surely i should get some indication of youve been to the gym x ti ames this week so far and you have y gym sessions remaining for this week in order to fulfil your habitual obligations again the information is there in the app but you have to acti havely seek it out maybe the more fastidious ti amekeepers will see to this without batting an eye but for forgetful adhdprone types like myself if its not right in front of me then it might as well not exist but all in all these are minor foibles fantastic app",
